|  21   |&#10004; | - Encode and decode strings - Encode strings by adding the count of chars in each string followed by a symbol to mark it as the end of count and the actual string itself. Decode by iterating through each char in the string until the next symbol mark to determine the count, then splice the string appropriately.<br> - Valid palindrome - Have l and r pointers starting at both ends of the string. Skip over non-alphanumerical letters. Stop the loop when l > r. <strong>Consider an edge case all letters are non-alphanumeric.</strong>
